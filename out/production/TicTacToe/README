The clever player starts from top left corner and checks if the space is empty then puts the mark down,
 if not empty then continues to search for the nearest empty spot.
This is good enough because the whatever player puts his mark randomly then the chances of him 
to put WIN_STREAK amount of marks in a row is very small.
The whatever player gets a random number for row and a different random number for the column 
then checks if the space is empty then puts down mark if not then gets again another 
two random numbers and continues that way until he puts down the mark.
